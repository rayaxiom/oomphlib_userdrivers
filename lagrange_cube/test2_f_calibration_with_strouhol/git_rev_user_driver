    cube.cc now performs as it does before. The problem was that
    I didn't set the Strouhol number.... why do we need this to lower
    iteration counts, I do not know.
    
    lgr_cube.cc also performs the same. But now I am switching two things:
    1) Changing it to oomph lib's GMRES
    2) Changing the inflow to vary with cos and the time.
