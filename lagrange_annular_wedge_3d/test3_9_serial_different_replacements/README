Hello friend!


In this test I am trying out two new scripts, gentest.sh and genqsub.sh

About gentest.sh:
New format, more modifiable. So each command line args has been pre-set,
above the combine_args() function.

The combine_args() function combines the args so that you can just run the 
program with $FULLRUNCOMMAND

So when ever we want to modify a parameter, we re-set it and call 
combine_args() again. This will update the variable FULLRUNCOMMAND and we 
can run it!

This is used to generate the tests. If we need to loop through some
parameter sweep, then we do a for loop, updating the tags.

If we want to do a few tests, we can manually change the tags (instead
of setting up lists and loops). This is the advantage to this. We do not
need to have loops.

About genqsub.sh

This generates the qsub script to be ran on the csf. It takes as input the
test list file generated by gentest.sh, so make sure that is called, and
make sure to update the name of it in the genqsub.sh script.

It gets the number of lines by itself, so everything is cool.
