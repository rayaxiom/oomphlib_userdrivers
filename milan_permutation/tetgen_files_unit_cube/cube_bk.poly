### Start of Node list
#---------------
# Part 1 - node list
# <num. nodes> <dim (3)> <num. of attributes> <boundary markers (0|1)>
# 8 nodes, 3 dim, no attribute, yes boundary marker
8 3 0 1

# Node index, node coordinates, boundary marker
1 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 0 0
3 1 0 1 0
4 0 0 1 0
5 0 1 1 0
6 0 1 0 0
7 1 1 0 0
8 1 1 1 0
### End of Node list


### Start of Facet list
#---------------

6 1 # number of faces; yes, we do have boundary markers

# Bottom boundary
1 0 2   # one polygon, zero holes, boundary 2
4 1 2 3 4  # four vertices and their indices in node list

# Top boundary
1 0 4  # one polygon, zero holes, boundary 4
4 5 6 7 8  # four vertices and their indices in node list

# Left boundary (inflow)
1 0 5  # one polygon, zero holes, boundary 5
4 1 4 5 6  # four vertices and their indices in node list

# Right boundary (outflow)
1 0 3  # one polygon, zero holes, boundary 3
